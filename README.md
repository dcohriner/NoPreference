### Purpose 
* To identify the most popular flight routes by airline between various destination cities
* To avoid possible delayed routes for travalers. 

### Affected Parties
This data visualization will prove useful to frequent flyers (business travelers), last minute bookings, and various other traveling throughout the rest of 2018.

### Scope: 
Due to the volume of flights per day in the United States, we will focus on 3 airports (LAX, CHI, JFK) and look at the following details for March 2018 (1-month data):
*	Airport Traffic
*	Airport Statistics such as On Time, Delays, Cancelled, etc… (Can be broken out by airline as well)
*	Most Popular Airlines (The airports selected are not Hubs so they should have somewhat of an even balance)
*	Most popular Routes by Airline and by City

### Summary of Analysis/Finding/Results: 
*   Southwest Airlines has the highest delayed flights, the total counts is 22257, total percentage is 22.54% on March 2018
*   Hawaiian Airlines is the most on time airline on March 2018,he total counts is 961, total percentage is 0.97%
*   LAX airport has teh higest delayed flights, total counts is 4362, total percentage is 4.42%.

### High-Level Overview of Technical Skills
The visualization must include:
*	Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, Mongo DB, SQLite, etc.)
*	Should fall into one of the four tracks:
   1. Custom “creative” D3.js project
   2. Combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
   3. Dashboard with multiple charts updating from same data source
   4. Thick server that performs multiple manipulation on data in database prior to visualization
*	Include one new JS library
*	Processed more than 600K records of data using Python and SQL
*	Include some level of UI

### Restrictions
*	Timing: We only selected a short period of the time (March 2018) to explore the data as the dataset is enomously large and cannot be loaded to github successfully
